I'm happy to anounce that I've been accepted to the MS Mechanical Engineering program at Purdue, University of Wisconsin-Madison, New York University and Arizona State University. I've committed to ASU, thanks to the generous financial support I'll be receiving through a fully funded teaching assistantship.
