I'm a Master's student at Arizona State University(ASU). I graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur(IITK) in 2024. 

I'm interested in Control Theory, Optimization, PDEs, and Machine Learning. My thesis advisor is [Prof. Yulia Peet](https://ypeet.github.io/isim/), and I work with her on the Lyapunov-based stability analysis of PDE systems, with an emphasis on developing fast, mathematically sound frameworks for problems in complex domains like cylindrical geometries.

Previously, I interned at **Coulomb AI** (a Y Combinator S21 startup), where I contributed to simulation pipelines and battery aging models for electric vehicles, with an emphasis on data-driven system behavior and predictive modeling. I also worked with [Prof. Leixin Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/oasislabasu/people?authuser=0) at ASU during the Fall 2024 semester on building a multitask, multifidelity Gaussian process model (MMGP) for optimizing the aerodynamic performance of a flapping NACA0012 airfoil. This involved developing 2D and 3D simulations in Julia using the WaterLily.jl CFD package to reduce the reliance on expensive high-fidelity data. I also briefly explored the use of graph neural networks for mesh-based flow simulation.
